# Repository Title Goes Here

Load balancer will distribute the work-load of your system to multiple individual systems, or group of systems to to reduce the amount of load on an individual system, which in turn increases the reliability, efficiency and availability of your enterprise application or website.

HAProxy, which stands for High Availability Proxy, is a popular open source software TCP/HTTP Load Balancer and proxying solution which can be run on Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD. Its most common use is to improve the performance and reliability of a server environment by distributing the workload across multiple servers (e.g. web, application, database). It is used in many high-profile environments, including: GitHub, Imgur, Instagram, and Twitter.

### TASKS ###
0. Double the number of webservers mandatory
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they‚Äôll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we‚Äôre placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

1. Install your load balancer mandatory
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.
