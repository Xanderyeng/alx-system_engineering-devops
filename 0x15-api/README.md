# 0x15. API

What is a REST API? REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer ‚Äî an almost meaningless description of the most-used web service technology! A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers.

Sharing data between two or more systems has always been a fundamental requirement of software development. For example, consider buying motor insurance. Your insurer must obtain information about you and your vehicle so they request data from car registration authorities, credit agencies, banks, and other systems. All this happens transparently in real-time to determine whether a policy can be offered.

Microservices have many benefits for Agile and DevOps teams - as Martin Fowler points out, Netflix, eBay, Amazon, Twitter, PayPal, and other tech stars have all evolved from monolithic to microservices architecture. Unlike microservices, a monolith application is built as a single, autonomous unit. This make changes to the application slow as it affects the entire system.  A modification made to a small section of code might require building and deploying an entirely new version of software.  Scaling specific functions of an application, also means you have to scale the entire application.
