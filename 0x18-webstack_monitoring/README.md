What is Server Monitoring?
In the past, implementing new servers meant that IT organizations had to invest heavily in data centers, hardware and the development of additional technical support and management capabilities. In today's increasingly cloud-focused enterprise computing ecosystem, IT organizations can access additional servers to satisfy a variety of functions with minimal overhead. Cloud service providers like Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) services on a pay-per-use basis, helping businesses to scale their networking, storage, servers and virtualization capabilities in the most cost-effective manner.

As organizations deploy more servers into the cloud, security can become a growing concern. Each additional network endpoint or cloud-deployed application represents a potential attack vector that a malicious actor could exploit to gain access to the network. Maintaining the performance and availability of servers, along with their security posture, can also play an important role in optimizing customer experience and minimizing unplanned downtime.

Because of these concerns, organizations that depend on servers that are deployed in the cloud must implement server monitor solutions that help maintain the security of cloud servers while tracking their performance and availability. Server monitoring can have different objectives and track different key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the type of server, but the primary objective of server monitoring is always to protect the server from possible failure that would interrupt service availability.
