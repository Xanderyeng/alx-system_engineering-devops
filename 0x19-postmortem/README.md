Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: 4 hours
Start Time: November 12, 2023, 09:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: November 12, 2023, 01:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: Authentication service outage affecting 30% of users; users experienced login failures and delayed access to secured resources.
Timeline:
09:00 AM: Issue detected by monitoring system, triggering alerts on increased authentication failures.
09:15 AM: Engineering team alerted, began initial investigation into authentication service logs.
09:30 AM: Assumed initial root cause to be a database query latency issue; investigation focused on database performance.
10:15 AM: Database performance tuning initiated, no improvement observed.
11:00 AM: Realized misdirection; issue traced to third-party API integration for multi-factor authentication.
11:30 AM: Incident escalated to senior development team and external API provider contacted for collaboration.
12:00 PM: Identified the root cause as a misconfigured API token; resolved by updating the token on our end.
01:00 PM: Service fully restored; users regained normal access to authentication services.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: Misconfigured API token for the multi-factor authentication provider led to authentication failures.
Resolution: Updated the misconfigured API token, restoring proper communication with the third-party service.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
â€ƒ
To Improve/Fix:
Enhance Monitoring: Strengthen monitoring systems to detect anomalies in third-party service interactions.
Documentation Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of API integration documentation to ensure accurate configuration.
Testing Procedures: Implement regular testing procedures for third-party integrations to catch configuration issues before deployment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Automate Token Rotation: Develop an automated system for regular rotation and validation of API tokens.
Update Runbook: Revise incident response runbooks to include specific steps for investigating and resolving third-party API issues.
Internal Training: Conduct training sessions for the team on the importance of thorough investigation before making assumptions about the root cause.
Communication Protocol: Establish a clear communication protocol for incidents involving external service providers to ensure prompt resolution.
